Nothing super interesting here. Just a way to manage all your docker containers. 

It looks someting like this.

You can run this service with the [docker file](.docker-compose.yml) I have provided.
I recommended running this BEFORE you start your projects but if you are alerady running services, don't worry. It'll automatically recognize them.

Or follow what I did and connect it to your cloudflare tunnel DNS. So you don't have to remember the ports and IP addresses.
